## Welcome to A11y Mapr: Reimagining Access for a More Human World

A11yMapr is a community-driven platform that maps and rates the accessibility of public and digital spaces. We are revolutionizing how people with disabilities interact—physically and digitally. We imagine a world where every person — regardless of disability — can navigate, access, and own both public and digital spaces with full autonomy and dignity. 

Built for, with, and by disabled people, this project allows everyone to contribute data about access barriers, inclusive features, and infrastructure gaps.

We believe accessibility is a collective responsibility and **you have a role to play**.


### Why A11yMapr?

According to the WHO:
- Over **1.3 billion people** globally live with significant disabilities (1 in 6 of us).
- Over **250 million** older adults experience moderate to severe disability.
Yet most real-world spaces — from sidewalks to schools — remain undocumented or inaccessible.

- **Accessibility Data is Missing**: There’s no centralized, open, and culturally relevant accessibility database for spaces globally.
- **Digital Tools Exclude Many**: Most mapping tools are not accessible themselves, and don't consider the realities of PWDs.
- **Inclusive Design Starts with Inclusive Data**: You can’t fix what you can’t measure. A11yMapr makes invisible barriers visible.

**A11yMapr bridges this gap.** It empowers communities to map accessibility, one place at a time.

## Key Features

- **Crowdsourced Reviews** – Submit photos, feedback, and accessibility reports of physical spaces.
- **AI-Powered Audits** – Analyze visual content for accessibility elements like ramps, stairs, signs.
- **Local Dashboards** – Cities and communities get real-time accessibility data and scores.
- **Multi-language Support** – Includes translation and localization for inclusive participation.
- **Open API** – Designed for civic integration (e.g., planning, education, transit).
